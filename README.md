# portfolio
personal portfolio code 
I built this portfolio to show off my skills learned as well as it's fun to maintain my personal site! This site is hosted by AWS S3. Created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Feel free to leave any suggestions and critique my code as I love to receive feed back! I hope to keep this updated with any other projects and skills learned along the way.
